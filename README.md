# Kiss & Makeup
[Check it out here!](https://rorywork.github.io/kiss-and-makeup/)

A stylish marketing website designed to promote and generate business for the client's Asian bridal hair and makeup business. The client is based within central London and is targeting business within that area.
The website features include a landing page, gallery of the artists work, an estimated prices page and a contact page containing a request quote form which can be used by a consumer to get an idea of what it will cost.  
  
Due to the nature of the business, high-quality images and examples of the artists work are key in impulsing a consumer to call the number or request a quote. As such the request quote button is more prominant than other pages, 
and the contact number appears reguarly throughout the site.    

The business goals of the website are:

* Provide brand awareness for the business.
* Showcase the artists work in one easy to reach destination.
* Generate telephone leads and email leads which can be converted into bookings.
* Guide customers towards either the phone number or the request quote form by using good UX.


Customer goals include:

* Getting design ideas for their own weddings.
* Viewing the artists work to  make an informed decision on whether it is the right service for them.
* Easy to contact the artists either via phone or via the request quote form.
* Simple, elegant process designed to counteract the stresses of getting married!


## UX

#### Ideal client
The ideal client for this business is:

Female  
Is getting married or attending a wedding/social event.  
Has a disposable income.  
Is South Asian or olive skinned.  
Wants to look amazing.  
Lives in London.  
Social media savvy.  

This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:

Based on my research there is a huge variety in the UX standard of other make-up artist's websites, they are often not responsive or out of date.  
The majority of websites are aimed at European skin tones, this one is specifically for olive skin, and women with Asian ethnicity.  
It will allow the customer to book in via phone or generate a quote depending on what they feel more comfortable with.  
The makeup artist has a large following on social media and as such comes up with bold, unique designs you likely will not be able to replicate elsewhere.  

This website is:   

Easy to use and elegant in design. It is aspirational and should conjure up thoughts of what the wedding day will feel like.  
Designed to draw attention to the stunning images and the work of the artist.  
Concise, all the information the client needs is there, without going into unnecessary detail.  
Designed to guide the user towards requesting a quote or calling the phone number, at which point finer details can be discussed with the artist.  

#### Client stories
As a user, I want the layout to be clean and simple, so I can easily navigate the site.
As a user, I want to be able to see examples of the artists work within the gallery so I can decide if it is right for me.  
As a user, I want to see a video of the artist performing so I can get a feel for their personality and service.  
As a potential client, I want to know what past clients looked like after the makeover, to see whether the artist has done a good job.  
As a potential client, I want a rough idea of the prices so I can decide if it is affordable and good value.  
As a potential client, I want to follow the artist on social media, so I can keep up with her latest makeovers and decide on a design for myself.  
As an interested client, I want to understand how I can contact the artist and how I can make a booking.  
As an interested client, I want a simple quote request form that only captures information that is relevant and necessary.  
As a returning visitor to the website, who has already decided to contact the artist, I want to be able to request a quote or get back in touch should I have a new requirement.

## Features

Each page has a responsive navigation bar which is used to move around the various pages in the site. This navigation bar contains the Lips Logo on the left and the Kiss and Makeup branding text.
This bar also contains a bootstrap button that can be used to go to the request quote form. There is a main image on each page which is fully responsive, the image changes when it reaches the 
mobile breakpoint to one which looks better on mobile sized devices. On top of this is an image overlay that contains a quote or some text from the artist which is appropriate to the page being 
viewed.  Each page also contains a pink banner with gold text overlayed on top, this tells the user what the page is for. 

Each page also contains a responsive footer that uses icons to link to the client's social media. This is useful as a consumer can keep up to date with the latest designs and engage more with the
artist. It also contains links to my Github so anyone interested in website design knows where to find my work, as well as link to the privacy policy which will be used to comply with GDPR in the future.
The final footer link is required to use the Lips Logo and credits the creator for their work. This is useful as anyone who likes the logo can check out more of their designs and is a good business practice. 

All information text and images from the artist are styled with a gold border to make them stand out, this is seen frequently throughout the site. 

#### Home

The home page contains an image banner that is fully responsive. Laying out 4 of the artist's images horizontally on medium to large screen sizes, and displays them vertically on mobile. 
The purpose of this is to initially impulse the user about the quality of the service on offer and provide a few key examples. Below this is an information text box that contains welcome text
explaining a little more about who the artist is. This allows the user to learn more about the service, below this is a contact number which when pressed will ring the client who can then
drive sales. Below this is another large image of a happy Indian couple which is used to signify how the consumer will feel should they buy the service.

#### Gallery

The gallery page contains 15 images of the artists work, which are all fully responsive using the Bootstrap grid. In mobile views, they align vertically allowing the user to get maximum image size on small screens and 
scroll through quickly. On medium and large screens the layout of the images is in pairs of two, with the larger vertical images aligned together with one at the bottom to provide a more stylish design. 

#### Prices

The prices page is clean and simple it uses an information text box similar to the one used on the home page to display the various services on offer. There is also a phone number link so that the artist is easily contactable
if the price point impulses someone to get in touch. The prices page also contains a testimonial quote from a customer, which is used before the footer. This builds trust in the business for a consumer as they can see evidence
that the client performs a high-quality service.

#### Contact/Request Quote

The key element of this page is the request quote bootstrap form. It has a simple design and only captures what is relevant and necessary to fulfill the quote as per the GDPR. Below this and before the footer is a message from the artist which is designed to leave a personal
and lasting impression on the consumer. This will make them feel special and like they are in good hands.


#### Features Left To Implement

* Privacy Policy link to link out to the client's privacy policy, currently it links to a template policy.
* GDPR cookie opt-in - this will take the form of a pop up on the landing page so a user can select their cookie settings.
* FAQ page so customers can quickly get answers to the most common questions.
* Video of the artist performing a makeover, this will be added to the website on either the home page or the pricing page once it is provided by the client. 


## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Jquery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
* [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)


## Testing

#### W3
I conducted automated testing using the W3 HTML checker, this displays any syntax errors within the HTML code, I ran it on each page and then went through and fixed each error one by one, until the validator produced no errors. This required me to run it
several times until it was error free.
 
#### Audits / Chrome Dev Tools
I used Chrome Dev Tools to run audits on the performance, accessibility and best practices on the website for both mobile and desktop layouts. I then took on board the feedback and made changes to my website where necessary in order to achieve higher scores. I came to the conclusion
some of the advice around accessibility would have hindered the design of the website so I made improvements where I could without majorly affecting the current design, as per my client's request.

#### Manual Testing
I have tested each page on the following browsers:  

* Google Chrome
* Apple Safari
* Microsoft Edge
* Internet Explorer

#### Devices Tested

* iPhone X
* iPhone 8
* Microsoft Surfacebook Pro
* Samsung Tablet
* Ultra Large Samsung Display 
* iPad Pro
* iPad

I found a bug whereby the `parallax` does not work in Safari, to combat this I have disabled it for mobile devices in order to generally increase load speeds until all mobile browsers support the functionality. 

So far, other than the `parallax` bug I have been unable to identify any issues with my tests, the website responds well on each screen size and seems to work across various browsers, during the development of the website I ensured I had a large screen, a 13 inch laptop screen an Ipad screen and a mobile screen 
at all times so that I could constantly check back and make sure the designs were working on each screen. I have also tested all the links and they all link out to the appropriate pages.

#### User Tests

I got members of my friends and family to try the website on their devices then asked for feedback, I would then review the feedback and implement it where relevant in the design. The initial feedback I received was that 
the original main images were not a high enough resolution for larger screens and I decided to use some high resolution stock photos to fix this. This resulted in the website looking a lot more professional and is a good example
of the testing and feedback enhancing the overall design of the website. 

I asked my peers on the Code Insitute Slack channel for feedback on the website and received the following feedback:

* My readme required some edits, I was advised that Fontawesome and Google Fonts need to go in my technology section I have now added them.
* It was suggested I add more comments to my HTML and CSS at the more complicated parts I have now put more comments in so other developers can follow what I am doing. 
* I was advised to add an attribute to make my privacy policy open in a separate window, I have now implemented this by using the `target="blank"` attribute on my privacy policy link. I also did this for my GitHub link.
* I was advised that the footer social links are very tall stacked on top of each other in mobile, and they are too far apart on wider screens. I kept them stacked on top of each other in mobile as I quite liked the design
  however I felt the second point was very valid so have brought them closer together on large screen sizes by using a media query which adds some margins to the left and right when the screen size hits 1200 pixels.
